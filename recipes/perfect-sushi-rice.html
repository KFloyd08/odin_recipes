        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Rice Add the rinsed rice to a saucepan with water (use 3 parts water to 2 parts rice). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and all the water has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>Cook the Vinegar Mixture Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Season the Rice Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice. Stir until the rice is nice and sticky — it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools.</li>
        </ol>
